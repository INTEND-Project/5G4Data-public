# INTEND-synthetic-data
This repo contains python programs and scripts used to generate synthetic data for the INTEND project 5G4DATA use-case provided by Telenor.

The infrastructure tentatively used in the 5G4DATA use-case is highly regulated since it is society critical network and compute infrastructure that are strictly regulated. Telenor is therefore not able to use real data for this use-case. The needed infrastructure data to provide end-to-end proof of concepts for this use-case has therefore been synthetically generated. The generated data will resemble real data but will not disclose real infrastructure information. There are several README.md files in the subfolders explaining how the different parts of the synthetic data has been generated.
