        <p class="text-left">
            Our use case (UC) within INTEND is called 5G4Data—short for customer-oriented 5G data infrastructure. It investigates how to make advanced network and compute features available to customers in a simplified, accessible way. We are aligning with ongoing work in the telecom community, such as the TM Forum's efforts around Autonomous Networks. Specifically, we are using the intent ontology they've developed as a foundation for expressing and interpreting customer intents. This formal, standardized approach is crucial to building scalable, interoperable solutions.

            The 5G4Data UC is a futuristic view of how Telco operators infrastructure might look like in the future. We have generated synthetic data for this foreseen infrastructure. In the map above, the markers indicate where the Edge data centers for the 5G4Data UC are located. It is possible to click on the markers to get more details about the datacentre at that location.

            The 5G4Data UC explores how 5G networks and connected Edge data centres can support an intent-based data pipeline continuum. It aims to demonstrate how natural language intents from customers can drive automated network configuration and workload deployment, with a focus on Quality of Service (QoS) assurance. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The UC leverages deployment of containerized workloads to Edge data centres to achieve performance characteristics that centralized computing cannot provide. A key aspect of the use-case is the dynamic provisioning of network slices, ensuring that decentralized workloads receive dedicated network resources optimized for the customer's needs. This guarantees that for example real-time inference applications can function without disruptions and with privacy in mind, thus addressing critical performance requirements not possible to achieve in centralized cloud-based solutions. To complement the network slicing capabilities, containerized workloads are deployed in container environments at Edge data centres, significantly reducing the distance between data sources (UEs) and processing nodes. This approach minimizes response times compared to traditional cloud-based inference, making real-time applications feasible across various domains.
        </p>
        <p>
            The use case is all about configuring the 5G network to meet needed requirements for an application that is accesed from devices connected to a 5G network (e.g. Mobile phones, AR Goggles, IoT devices, Drones). In order to meet the latency needs of an application it might be needed to deploy or move the application to an Edge datacenter. A user expresses what their goal is in natural language using the inChat tool and inChat needs to find out what type of intent is needed. For this use case, two types of intents are possible: a) Intents that results in configuration of the 5G network using a slice, b) Deployement of an application to an edge datacenter. The combination of the two is also possible. inChat needs to figure out if a) or b) or a combination of the two are needed. Click the next button to know more about how this can be done.

        <p>
            Although our INTEND UC has a defined scope, it supports a broader vision: intent-driven, autonomous network operations. As networks become more complex and customer expectations continue to rise, this shift will be critical. The INTEND project is an important step in Telenor's journey toward meeting those challenges and preparing for the next generation of communication services.
