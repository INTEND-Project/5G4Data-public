This folder contains several files that describes the 5G4DATA use-case infrastructure

| File name                  | Description                           |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Nordic_Distances_Matrix.csv | Distances in km between all the Edge Data centers |
| Nordic_Latencies_Matrix.csv | Round-trip latencies in **ms** between all the Edge Data centers. The measurements represents the latency in the transport network (fiber optic cables). |
| Nordic_Bandwidth_Matrix.csv | Bandwith in **Tbit/s** between all the Edge Data centers. The measurements represents the bandwidth in the transport network (fiber optic cables). |
| Nordic_Packet_Error_Rate_Matrix.csv | Packet error rate (PER) in **packets/s** between all the Edge Data centers. The measurements represents the PER in the transport network (fiber optic cables).|
| Nordic_Cities_Mercator.pdf | This is just a plot of the geographical position of the Edge data centers. |
