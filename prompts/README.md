# Prompts used to generate synthetic data for the 5G4DATA use-case
This folder contains prompts used to generate diverse syntethic data for the INTEND project 5G4DATA use-case provided by Telenor.

# Bandwidth and packet error
The prompt to generate bandwidth and packet error data between edge clusters is found in the **prompt_bandwidth.md** file. The LLM model used was OpenAI ChatGPT 4o. The output from the LLM model can be found in the files *../generated-syntetic-data/Nordic_Bandwidth_Matrix.csv* and *Nordic_Packet_Error_Rate_Matrix.csv*. The files with same name but with *.xlsx* extencions where generated using Excel (by opening the csv file in Excel and store the result in xlsx format).
