# TODO
## Intent related
- Add creation timestamp to the intent to be able to display the 10 latest intents
- Add owner and handler information to the intent to allow flow animations
- Add provenence info (parent intent)
- Add intent state (not in the intent, but as metadata tagged with intent id?)

## Dashboard related
- Add dashboard for synthetic data visualisation (based on inGraph representation of the synthetic data), i.e. a map similar to what we have in the tutorial.
- Modify the table view panel of intents to include only the last 10?
- Look into how to add clickable buttons to table view flow animation (based on timestamps?)
