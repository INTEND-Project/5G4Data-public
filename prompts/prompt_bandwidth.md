The hubs are all connected with fiber networks of new advanced types with bandwidth between 20 and 60 Tbs/s. The hubs are:
Tromsø, Harstad, Bodø, Trondheim, Oslo, Bergen Stavanger in Norway, Oulu and Helsinki in Finland, Stockholm, Malmø, Gothenburg and Luleå in Sweden and Copenhagen and Odense in Denmark. 
The rest of the cities are connected to nearest hubs with older technology fiber cables with bandwidth between 20Gbs/s up to 2Tbs/s. The distances between the cities are:
